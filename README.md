# OpenCV Projects: Simple, Fun & Useful OpenCV Examples

## Description
A collection of programs, that consists of the most primitive and simple, yet some of the most crucial elements of image processing using OpenCV, such as:
- Color detection
- Face detection (from a supplied image)
- Face detection (live from your webcam)
- Working with images, shapes and text
- Finding points in an image and warping them — *very interesting*
- Horizontal and vertical image stacking

This collection of programs was created in Python, for the purpose of learning and studying image processing and its capabilities using OpenCV. The inspiration to *learn* implementing OpenCV arose from the university program "Digital Signal & Image Processing" in my final academic year which I found very interesting; and [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQeoO7MI0Bs "This YouTube video") was the huge inspiration I required to finally get off of my proverbial butt and actually *implement* image processing in these programs.
